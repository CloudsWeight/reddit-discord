# Reddit Discord
A bot using discord.py and asyncpraw to return 10 results from any subreddit.  
- $posts cars top 2 - this command will return the top 2 results for the subreddit news
- $google cars - this will return any results found using degoogle

## To Do
- Commands:
  +    (Current) Usage: $posts [(subreddit)] [new/top] [Number of Posts]      
  +    Add more features with [commands](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ext/commands/commands.html).
- Messages - Return each post link instead of a list, format each response, create more detailed views.
- Content - Use more APIs to gather interesting data to post to discord (eg. Financial news, security news,weather reports, youtube)
- Degoogle - optimize and make search results more robust and relevant
